# Depresion-Detection-using-CNN-and-RNN
This project focuses on detecting signs of depression from spoken audio using a CNN-BiLSTM deep learning model. Depression can influence speech patterns such as tone, rhythm, pause duration, and energy level — and this model attempts to learn these subtle acoustic cues.
